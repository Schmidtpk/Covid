# Covid-19 Policy Measure Impact Evaluation

This git repo contains code and data for the analysis of the effect of different policy measures on the spread of #Covid-19.

The data on implemented policy measures is being crowdsourced via google sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYfD3vvSEaW3Cq9-UZoDtlKIfaMMVJq8XnV9XJUdK3s/edit?usp=sharing (ask simon for write access and what to do if you want to contribute).

The analysis is carried out via R Markdown in this repository.
